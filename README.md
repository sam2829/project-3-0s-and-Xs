# 0's and X's the game!
0's and X's is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can try to beat the computer by connnecting three X's in a line whether it be in the same row, column or diagonal before computer does with 0's. Take it in turns to select your positions on the grid.

Here is a liver version of my project:

## How To Play

The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You are X and the computer is 0. Players will take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row, column or diagonally is the winner.

The user will first enter there name before starting the game. The user will then be asked to select a number between 1 and 9 as to where they would like to position there marker on the grid. The square in the top left corner will be the value of one, the squares will go up in order from left to right and then down to the next row.

Once the user selects a grid position the computer will then select a random grid position, this will continue until there has been a declared winner or a tie.

User must select a number between 1 and 9 and once that has not been selected previously by the user or computer.
