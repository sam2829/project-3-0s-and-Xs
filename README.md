# 0's and X's the game!
0's and X's is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can try to beat the computer by connnecting three X's in a line whether it be in the same row, column or diagonal before computer does with 0's. Take it in turns to select your positions on the grid.

Here is a liver version of my project:
